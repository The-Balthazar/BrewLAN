#summary Installation guide and a list of downloads for BrewLAN
#labels Phase-Deploy
==Installation==
A compilation of all the various BrewLAN downloads. They usually require installation in the same way; extract the archive into the SUPCOM:FA `mods` folder, deleting older versions first. Newer versions also require a .SCD part going into the `gamedata` folder and the other part going into the `mods` folder OR the entire thing going into the `gamedata` folder. The all .SCD version have stopped, however, as they seemed to cause desync errors during online play. If you don't have a `mods` folder make one; the file hierarchy, game installation dependant, should be along the lines of: "`C:\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\mods\`" or alternatively in your documents folder "`C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\My Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\mods`". Always remember to remove old versions first and that all versions require the [http://supremecommander.filefront.com/file/Global_Icon_Support;100370 Blackops Global Icon Support mod]. The in-development SVN version is now up and running although I wouldn't advise its use over the individual download versions, as they aren't subject to change.
==SVN download==
  * _This section of the guide assumes you have TortoiseSVN installed_
The download of SVN version of the mod is done in two parts to prevent the SVN client messing with vanilla/other mods files. But first off remove any old versions of BrewLAN you may have.
  # In one of your Forged Alliance mod folders create a folder called "BrewLAN" then right click it and select "SVN Checkout" and set the repository URL as "`http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mods/BrewLAN/`", checkout directory should already be filled in. Checkout depth: fully recursive; head revision. Then click OK.
  # Then download the [http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gamedata/brewlan.scd brewlan.scd] and place it into your gamedata folder. There is no good was of doing this step with an SVN client, which means it needs manually updating for each change.

==Beta downloads==
  * [http://www.moddb.com/mods/brewlan/downloads/brewlan-02-beta Version 0.2.0b] (ModDB mirror)
  * [http://supremecommander.filefront.com/file/BewLAN_Mod;105003 Version 0.2.0b] (Filefront mirror)
==Alpha downloads==
The alpha stage downloads either contain unfinished parts/units or are bugged in some way, although they are all generally playable, otherwise they wouldn't get uploaded. They also require the Blackops Global Icon Support mod like the beta's. I make no guarantees  for the alphas; information on installation and such may be incomplete, missing or outdated. All alphas are hosted on Mediafire. The very latest in-development version is only available on SVN.
