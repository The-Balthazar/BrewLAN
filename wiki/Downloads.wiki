#summary Installation guide and a list of downloads for BrewLAN
#labels Phase-Deploy
==Installation==
A compilation of all the various BrewLAN downloads. They usually require installation in the same way; extract the archive into the SUPCOM:FA `mods` folder, deleting older versions first. Newer versions also require a .SCD part going into the `gamedata` folder and the other part going into the `mods` folder OR the entire thing going into the `gamedata` folder. The all .SCD version will be stopping, however, as they seem to cause desync errors during online play. If you don't have a `mods` folder make one; the file hierarchy, game installation dependant, should be along the lines of: "`C:\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\mods\`". Always remember to remove old versions first and that all versions require the Blackops Global Icon Support mod.

==Beta downloads==
  * [http://www.moddb.com/mods/brewlan/downloads/brewlan-02-beta Version 0.2.0b] (ModDB mirror)

==Alpha downloads==
The alpha stage downloads either contain unfinished parts/units or are bugged in some way, although they are all generally playable, otherwise they wouldn't get uploaded. They also require the Blackops Global Icon Support mod like the beta's. I make no guarantees  for the alphas; information on installation and such may be incomplete, missing or outdated. All alphas are hosted on Mediafire.
