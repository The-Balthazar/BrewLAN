#summary Download lists and installation guides for BrewLAN.
#labels Phase-Deploy
The latest versions of BrewLAN require the [http://forums.gaspowered.com/viewtopic.php?t=36996 Global Icon Support mod v5] by Blackops, so before continuing further download and install that. Versions 0.3 and below require the Global Icon Support mod v2, available [http://supremecommander.filefront.com/file/Global_Icon_Support;100370 here]. Versions with multilingual support, version 0.3 and above, do not require special installation.

==Installation==
If you wish to use SVN skip this section. The general instructions for installation are:
  # Remove old versions if applicable.
  # Copy the /BrewLAN/ folder into your Forged Alliance /mods/ folder by default located at either one, or both, of the following; if neither exists then create one:
   * "`...\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\mods\`"
   * "`...\My Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\mods\`".
  # Copy the "`brewlan.scd`" into the Forged Alliance /gamedata/ folder found by default at:
   * "`...\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\gamedata\`"
Pre 0.2.2 releases don't require an SCD file. The 'SCD only' version of 0.2.2a doesn't require the /BrewLAN/ folder as its contained within the SCD file.

==SVN download==
â€ƒ_This section of the guide assumes you have TortoiseSVN installed_

The download of SVN version of the mod is done in two parts to prevent the SVN client messing with vanilla/other mods files. But first off remove any non-SVN versions of BrewLAN you may have.
  # In your Forged Alliance mod folder (see [#Installation installation] above if you cant find it) create a folder called "BrewLAN", the name is important for everything to work, then right click it and select "SVN Checkout" and set the repository URL as "`http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mods/BrewLAN/`", checkout directory should already be filled in. Checkout depth: fully recursive; head revision. Then click OK.
  # Then download the [http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gamedata/brewlan.scd brewlan.scd] and place it into your gamedata folder. There is no good way of doing this step with an SVN client, which means it needs manually updating for each change.
To update your SVN version of BrewLAN simply right click the folder and click SVN update, updating the SCD file unfortunately requires manually re-downloading it, unless you have a better way of doing it.
