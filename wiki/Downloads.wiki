#summary Download lists and installation guides for BrewLAN.
#labels Phase-Deploy
Pre 0.4.4 versions of BrewLAN require the [http://forums.gaspowered.com/viewtopic.php?t=36996 Global Icon Support mod v5] by Blackops. Versions 0.3 and below require the Global Icon Support mod v2, available [http://supremecommander.filefront.com/file/Global_Icon_Support;100370 here]. Most versions of BrewLAN only used BOGIS as a double redundancy, so the hard requirement has been removed in the latest versions.

==Installation==
If you wish to use SVN skip this section. The general instructions for installation are:
  # Remove old versions if applicable.
  # Copy the /BrewLAN/ folder into your Forged Alliance /mods/ folder. You may have to create one if you have not installed any mods before. Possible default locations are:
   * "`...\Steam\SteamApps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\mods\`".
   * "`...\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\mods\`"
   * "`...\My Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\mods\`"
  # Copy the "`brewlan.scd`" into the Forged Alliance /gamedata/ folder found by default at:
   * "`...\Steam\SteamApps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\gamedata\`"
   * "`...\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\gamedata\`"
*If you are experiencing missing icons, textures the SCD file isn't installed correctly.*

==SVN download==
â€ƒ_This section of the guide assumes you have TortoiseSVN installed_

The download of SVN version of the mod is done in two parts to prevent the SVN client messing with vanilla/other mods files. But first off remove any non-SVN versions of BrewLAN you may have.
  # In your Forged Alliance mod folder (see [#Installation installation] above if you cant find it) create a folder called "BrewLAN", the name is important for everything to work, then right click it and select "SVN Checkout" and set the repository URL as "`http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mods/BrewLAN/`", checkout directory should already be filled in. Checkout depth: fully recursive; head revision. Then click OK.
  # Then download the [http://brewlan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gamedata/brewlan.scd brewlan.scd] and place it into your gamedata folder. 
To update your SVN version of BrewLAN simply right click the folder and click SVN update, updating the SCD file unfortunately requires manually re-downloading it, unless you set up the gamedata folder in a similar way to the BrewLAN folder.
