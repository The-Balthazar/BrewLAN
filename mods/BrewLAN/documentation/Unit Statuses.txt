Errors list/the other to-do list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* The Atlantis ignores its rolloff orders from the Gantry.
* SRS0401 lacks weapons.
* Wilson lacks treadmarks for its front tracks.
* Zenith has unused bones.
* The Absolution can't hover over units.
  * Other experimentals walk through armored walls.
* Megalith built eggs bug out when at the pop cap. (vanilla bug)
* Mobile anti nukes start building an anti nuke immediately, despite already having full capacity, leading to 2/1 built if it finishes.
  * The rate of fire of the mobile anti nukes also means that its likely to fire both at the same target, making having two redundant unless its a seraphim experimental nuke.
* The Cybran T3 Cloakable Fab pauses its production when the cloak is disabled.
* Change the explosion graphics of the T2 power storages to propperly represent the explosion size.
* Add unit orders to the blips of the Aeon Decoy plane, if possible. (IssueGuard)
* Nuke mines should have the option to auto explode, but be set to manual from the off.
* Armored walls (and probably other walls) need to be repaired slower.
* New prettier wall script involving a rotator, a slider, and position detection, for diagonals.
* Fix the Iyadesu.
* Tech 1 mobile shield generators? (Ella, Parashield, Umbra)
* Replace the stargate iris effect with a seperate entity so it can have ripple effects.
* Find a way to increase static shield radius and maintenence cost increases when built on water.
* Give the Seraphim T3 Gunship a more interesting weapon than the same as the T2.
* Give the UEF walls, and Bessemer Reactor real distance models.
* Do something with the repair ship idea.
* Do something with the cybran stealth field sub idea.
* Create a UI for the contents of the Ivan.
* Make the damage test unit look like a Nokia 3310.

Modded Units:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  All Factions: 
  	T1 landscout
  		* Gave omni at a range of 2, unlisted in game.
  		  * Allows T1 scouts that 'walk into' cloaked & stealthed units to see them.
  		  * There is a chance that units already had this, but never told anyone.            
  
  	Torpedo Bombers
  		* Gave the ability to land on water.                  
    
    Experimental Buildings
      * Added appropriate build menu sorting.
        * This seperates them from the mobile experimentals.
          * Seraphim already did this.        

    Support Commanders
      * Added an enhancement for field engineer tech.
    
    Bombers
      * Bombers have been granted a 95% damage resistance to bombs while they are in the air.
        * This is mostly because of an unfortunate interaction between bombers and the size of the Iron Curtain.

  ***  Completely non-existant
  **   Partially existant, but disabled
  *    Buildable, but only partially functioning


*** UEF Experimental Assault Bot/tank
  * Either in the shape of a large Titan or more humanoid shaped OR a large assault tank.
    * Possibly a two part splitting bot. Cain and Abel or something cool.

UEF Panopticon: Experimental Sensor Array
  * Gives vision of enemy non-ACU, non-wall, non-mine non-cloaked units.
    * Wont affect within 50 of a Darkness.
  * Currently has no unique model.
  * Also todo: Add camera teleport effect.            


UEF Centurion: Experimental AA gunship
  * Texture unfinished. Could be more efficiently UV mapped.     

UEF Ivan: Experimental Drop-Pod Artillery
  * Functionally a factory that deletes the things it makes then adds the unit code to the projectiles which spawn them in the other side.
    * Needs a way to handle shields propperly either: 
      * Bouncing off shields.
      * Or piercing shields and reducing the life of the contents based on the number of shields passed.
    * Currently sets the health to 25% if it hits a shield.            
    * Range should probably decrease for large ammos.
    * Possibly pass kills of the units back to the cannon?
    * Has an issue related to restarting skirmish games that can result in 'ghost' units appearing in the next game where it was.                                             
        
UEF Gantry: Experimental Factory
  * Almost completely 100% Fully funtional.
    * Still to do:                 
      * Hook \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua and/or \lua\factions.lua to get the idle icon working.
      * Maybe add some kind of pedistal effect for building aircraft upon, especially on water.
        * Would need to wait for the current unit to be completed, especially if its a ship.
        * Would also need some visual justification for it while not there, or to maybe comprised of energy effects.                       
      * Add a OnDamaged twitch animation. So it looks like its in pain.
      * The Atlantis gets stuck in it. IssueDive is used to get it out, but it forgets/ignores its orders at some point.
      * Small non-air units take forever to leave. Maybe use scripts from the Fatboy to quickly move them.
      * Find a way to allow building of things the UI is currently disabling. Possibly to have it swap modes briefly.                             
                  
Seraphim totally not a stargate
  * Requires two to be functional. Duh.
  * Still to do:
    * Add a ferry point icon to make transporting things through it easy.
    * Possibly allow firing through the wormhole.
    * Do a slight rework so that rather than instantly teleporting units that go near it, it tracks them until they have passed the center of it.                 

*** Seraphim Experimental Mine?
  * To be an experimental for the field engy.
  * Possibile functions:  
    * Releasing a residual energy signature.
    * Self replicating mines.
    * Damage over time effect.       

*** Seraphim Experimental Shield projection facility.
  * Something between a shield gen and the eye of something or other in appearance.
  * To create individual shields around each unit within the radius, probably with a ghost unit attached.
    * Shields should share an overall health, and need some way to scale with the unit it surrounds.
  * Multiple towers could cause some problems, but shields will likely take damage at the same time on a unit, due to being the same size. 

* Seraphim Iyadesu
  Formerly Experimental Engineer (Prior to r205)
  Formerly Experimental Field Engineer (As of r205, removed as 2014-08-08)
  Experimental Ressurection Unit
    * Script attached to the reclaim command.
    * Had to totally overwrite the old CreateWreckageProp function for it to work.                 

Seraphim Suthanus: Rapid-Fire Artillery
  * Fully functioning.
  * Possibly the cause of weird crashes.  

Aeon Absolution: Experimental Siege Tank
  * Mostly finished texture that needs more details.
  * Has its big cannon and two TMD's.
  * Totally isn't an eldar grav tank. Nope nope nope. 

** Cybran Experimental Missile ship
  * Initial ideas:
    * a cross between the Sea Shadow and a Houbei class missile boat.
    * Stealth, and tac missiles.
    * Possible strat missiles.
    * Possible cloak, disabled during firing and or really high power cost.
  * Current implementation:
    * A Battleship with legs.
    * Currently no functioning weapons, but can stamp on things. 
  * New idea:
    * Carrier/battleship. With legs.
    * Unique T3 fighter/bombers.               

Cybran Iron Curtain: Experimental Shield Generator
  * Functions as a shield.
  * Used to want the shield to shrink on damage. Not sure anymore.  
    * Would need to adapt the force shield script for this.       
  * Not 100% satisfied with the current mesh.

Cybran Scathis Mk 2: Experimental Rapid-fire Artillery
  * Uses most of the parts of the original. 

Cybran Darkness: Experimental Omni Disruption Facility
  * Uses the model of the QAI Mainframe from the campaign.
  * Was briefly called Oscuras before reverting back to Darkness.
    * I realised that any unit for which I try to avoid refering to it by name, has a bad name. Sorry Kris.

Abandonned Ideas:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
UEF Doomsday Machine: Experimental Point Defence
  * Was supposed to be a callback to the old TA unit.
    * An uninteresting idea badly implemented. Removed.
    * Was only still in the source files for nostalgia.
      * Removed as of r146         
                                
UEF Engineering Facility 'The Pound'
  * A facility that houses a large number of Rover drones.
  * Do you want lag? Because this is how you get lag.

Kris' notes on further experimental buildings
* My notes on his notes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Experimental Sensor Array - You could probably spin it for anyone. Maybe it could give True-Sight for the whole map. How OP would that be?
* Probably OP against players, less so against bots; and useless with fog off which we usually do against bots, particularly amusing against Cybran, since it also makes their experimental jamming thing useless. 

Experimental Strat. Def. - Seraphim or Cybran? Much larger range and could return them to sender.
* Return to sender is probably too much for nukes.

Experimental Defense Structures - A UEF one that combines all three seems fine. Also acceptable would be a Cybran one that just ports the Obelisk of Darkness from C&C.
* Maybe attach the torpedo section to the floatation, so its not there when on land.
 
Experimental Air Staging - This is the only one that I don't have an idea for.


Experimental Resource Storage - Aeon. When it's full on Energy, it emits a shield. When it's full on mass, it emits a Health Regen aura. There are a pile of issues with this, but I just thought it was a cool idea.
* Would need to be careful with the shield, to make sure its not just used as another shield generator, but with slower responce times.
  * Also don't want to make the Iron Curtain redundant.  
* Health buff aura on mass full, Health regen on energy full.
  * Is this pulling players in the wrong direction? Do we want them to be stockpiling and wasting resources for effect? 

Experimental Wall - Seraphim. Firestorm Walls. Also applicable, Stealth Firestorm Walls for Cybran. (i.e, they're invisible until you walk over them and they melt your face).
* Definitely avoids the issue of the fact that experimentals will just walk over them, if everyone is supposed to be able to walk over them.

Experimental Engi. Station - Probably not a good idea now that they've been added to Seraphim (did you ever give them to Aeon?). I don't have any good ideas to make them interesting either (Unless you're mad enough to want to do infinite/super-huge range). Stylistically, it could be a bundle of Nano-Bots for Cybran, some ethereal light bubbles for Seraphim/Aeon, or just bigger drones for UEF.
* Experimental engineering is probably still a terrible idea.

* Walls with personal shields
* A land version of the air repair pad, like of tibsun.
* T1-3 Jammers

BrewUI
* Field engineer UI changes. Completely inactive without BrewLAN, even while enabled.
* Overwrites the two functions completely when active.
* Completely optional, for compatibility.
* Is overwritten by the support commander upgrade manager thing in GazUI and such.

BrewLAN: Gantry AIx 1 & 2
* These are difficulty increasing module for AIx that affect the Gantry.
  * 1 has linear increases in build speed and resource cheats.
  * 2 has a mass gated exponential increase in the two.   
* Also poses as an example for other on how to mod BrewLAN.
   

Crystal Hill
* King of the hill style: Spawns a crystal dead center of the map.
  * Controlling it at the end of 20 mins causes game win.
  * A change of hands below the 5 minute mark causes the time to increase back to 5 minutes.
* While spawning the crystal will remove the nearest civilian building in the area, and will occupy its space. If any area near enough.   
* Fully functional except the AI doesn't care yet.  
* Language strings exist for English, German & French.

Paragon Game
* Few vs Many aesymetric style gameplay.
  * Player(s) on the smallest team(s) get a paragon, SACU, and shields.
* Uses all default language strings.  

Metal World                                
* Removes MEX position requirements, and mass points.
* Fully functional, except real AI control.
  * AI gets some hardcore hax to prevent breaking them. (For sorian AI.)   

Waterlag
* Adds aquatic abilities to each building that isn't a factory, wall, silo, or experimental.
* Spawns an entity that looks like legs underneith UEF and Cybran buildings that were made aquatic by waterlag and dont have defined floatation bones.

* Aircraft barrel roll.
* Random asteroid showers.
* Have cloaked/stealthed units able to detect when they are detected.
  * Might be easier to implement the other way round; the omni checks on detecting them.
* Swap mass & energy.
* Team coloured lasers.
