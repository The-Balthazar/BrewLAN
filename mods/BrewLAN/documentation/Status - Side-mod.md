# Side-mod status

## BrewLAN modules
Mods that require BrewLAN to be functional. For the most part these are totally dormant if they are enabled and BrewLAN isn't.

### BrewUI
* Field engineer UI changes. Completely inactive without BrewLAN, even while enabled.
* Overwrites the two functions completely when active.
* Completely optional, for compatibility.
* Is overwritten by the support commander upgrade manager thing in GazUI and such.

### BrewLAN: Gantry AIx 1–3
* These are difficulty increasing AIx cheat mods that affect the Gantry, and give it increased production speed. With different caveats.
  1. Linear increases in build speed and resource cheats over time.
  2. Player-mass gated exponential increase in build speed and resources.
  3. Like 2, but offers discounts instead of resources.
* These also function as demonstrations on modding other mods non-destructively.

## Gameplay
Mods that alter gameplay in a fixed way.

### Antimass
* Swaps mass and energy production.
  * Multiplies the new energy production by 10.
  * Divides the new mass production by 10.

### Crystal Hill
* King of the hill style: Spawns a crystal dead center of the map.
  * Controlling it at the end of 20 mins causes game win.
  * A change of hands below the 5 minute mark causes the time to increase back to 5 minutes.
* While spawning the crystal will remove the nearest civilian building in the area, and will occupy its space. If any area near enough.
* Fully functional except the AI doesn't care yet.
* Language strings exist for English, German & French.

### Metal World
* Removes MEX position requirements, and mass points.
* Fully functional, except real AI control.
  * AI gets some hardcore hax to prevent breaking them. (For sorian AI.)

### Paragon Game
* Few vs Many asymmetric style gameplay.
  * Player(s) on the smallest team(s) get a paragon, SACU, and shields.
* Uses all default language strings.

### TeaD
* Tower Defense mod. Where you defend a cup of tea.

### Waterlag
* Adds aquatic abilities to each building that isn't a factory, wall, silo, or experimental.
* Spawns an entity that looks like legs underneath UEF and Cybran buildings that were made aquatic by waterlag and don't have defined floatation bones.

## RNG bullshit
Mods that alter gameplay with random effects.

### Cost Variance
* Adds a +/- 50% random cost variation to all non-economic units, and alters some stats to match.

### Crate Drop
* Adds a random Tiberian Sun style crate drop.
  * Rewards include hats.

### Lucky Dip
* Requires both BlackOps and BrewLAN to do anything.
  * For each similar unit added by both, randomly restricts one for each player.
    * Do you get a Manticore this game or a Hades? How about your opponent?

## Plenus
Satisfaction guaranteed; mods with sim-side aesthetic changes and meta-mods.

### Experimental Icons Overhaul
* Doesn't work on FAF for scd reasons.
* Dynamically changes units experimental icons from a circle to something useful.
  * Has a system that includes comparative weapon DPS for deciding icons.
* Specifically tested for use with Total Mayhem, Experimental Wars, BlackOps, 4th Dimension, and X'Treme Wars.

### Pulchritudinousity
* For taking better screenshots:
  * Increases the view distances of models and tarmacs 1000x.
  * Makes spawned in units auto-give themselves tarmacs.
