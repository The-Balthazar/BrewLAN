This mod requires the Blackops global icon support mod.

	|Intro

The idea to create the BewLAN mod essentially came from two SUPCOM:FA matches, one T1 only match, one match using the Blackops mod. Both of which seemed horribly balanced. After which we vowed never to use the Blackops mod again, and not to do another T1 only match without first fixing the frustrating balance bugs and removing/creating ways of countering exploits. And so the T1 Balance Mod was born, which grew into the BrewLAN mod; named after Joshua Wilsons BrewLAN party where we first played a match with the first alpha.
