General to-do list/ideas list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* Mobile Radar Jammers
* More aquatic buildings
* Mines and mine layers (Land, Naval)
* Seraphim experimental mine. (Possibly releasing a residual energy signature as its thing)
* BARREL ROLL
* Change the explosion graphics of the T2 power storages to propperly represent the explosion size.
* Add unit orders to the blips of the Aeon Decoy plane.

Errors list/the other to-do list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* SRS0401 lacks weapons.
* SRA0306 has an intel error. (line 32)
* Wilson lacks treadmarks for its front tracks.
* Zenith has unused bones.
* The Gantry lacks a lod1 normal map.
* The Absolution can't hover over walls and such
  * Experiments with making it technically an aircraft had weird dalek-like side effects.
* Need to mess with \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua to get the idle icons of the field engineers and gantry working propperly.
* UEF engineer built versions of gantry experimentals bug out when at pop cap.
  * This issue also exists with Megalith built eggs, but is less visible.
* Mobile anti nukes start building an anti nuke immediately, despite already having full capacity, leading to 2/1 built if it finishes.
  * The rate of fire of the mobile anti nukes also means that it fires both at the same target, making having two redundant unless its a seraphim exp. nuke.
* The two super secret naval shield generators need making more accessable, and less T3 only.
* The UEF and Aeon T1 shield generators need increasing back to the size of all the others, with the coverage propportionally increasing along with them.
* One race should get a T3 torpedo launcher that can be built on land.

Modded Units:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  All Factions: 
  	T1 landscout
  		* Gave omni at a range of 2, unlisted in game.
  		  * Allows T1 scouts that 'walk into' cloaked & stealthed units to see them.    
  
  	Torpedo Bombers
  		* Gave the ability to land on water.
  		  * Given both TRANSPORTATION and HOVER categories so they dont get shot by torpedoes       
    
    Experimental Buildings
      * Added appropriate build menu sorting.
        * This seperates them from the mobile experimentals.        
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Aeon:
  	T2 Shield Generator
  		* Allowed upgrade to the T3 shield gen.
  		* Allowed rebuild bonus on T2 and T3 wreckages.
  
  	T3 Shield generator
  		* Allowed T2 to upgrade into it.
  
    T3 Heavy Assault Bot
      * Decreased the cost and stats to be comparable with that of the Titan, the Loyalist, and that Serephim one.    
      
  	T3 Rapid Fire Artillery Installation
  		* Recategorised as an experimental.
  		* Gave it the experimental level health regen.
  
  	T3 Quantum Optics
  		* Reduced build footprint.
  		* Enabled click-drag build.
  
  	Galactic Collossus

  	ED2
    	* Changed to Tech 1.
    	* Reduced health to 200.
  
    ED3
      * Made buildable at Tech 2.
    	* Reduced health to 300.

  	T3 Gunship
  		* AA damage increased. Still token.
  
    T3 Anti nuke defence
      * Changed tarmac.
  
  	Scathis
      * Replaced with immobile version for both balance and aesthetic purposes.
        * Original still in game but removed from build menus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  UEF:
    T2 Field Engineer
      * Gave a unique buildable category..
            
    T2+T3 Shield Generators
      * Unified and normalised tarmacs.

      * Left a decoy for the engineers to build.
        * Works in a similar way as the Megalith eggs.
        * Passes any damage it recieves under construction to the eventual real Fatboy.
        * Doing it the other way (Putting the fake in the Gantry) results in it losing the orders to leave the Gantry.       
        * Most people wont notice the difference.
        * Can cause issues while at pop cap.                                              
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   ?  ???
    PROFIT!

UEF Experimental Assault Bot/tank
  * Either in the shape of a large Titan or more humanoid shaped OR a large assault tank.
    * Possibly a two part splitting bot. Cain and Abel or something cool.

UEF Centurion: Experimental AA gunship
  * Texture unfinished. Could be better UV mapped.     

UEF Ivan: Experimental Drop-Pod Artillery
  * Fires projectiles that look like drop pods and spawn mech marines on impact.
    * Bouncing script doesnt work on shields.
    * Range should probably decrease for large ammos.
    * Fucks up on aiming due to bone sharing.
    * Unfinished replacement model on an old un-connected HDD, from the computer upgrade.                                      
        
UEF Gantry: Experimental Factory
  * Can now be considered fully funtional.
    * Still possibly to do:                 
      * Mess with \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua and/or \lua\factions.lua to get the idle icon working.
      * Add some kind of pedistal effect area for aircraft, especially on water.
        * Would need to wait for the current unit to be completed, especially if its a ship.               
      * Add death animation.
      * The Atlantis gets stuck in it; looks like something to do with its oncreate scripts at first glance.
        * It can be manually removed by making it submerge first. (IssueDive maybe?)
      * Use scripts from the Fatboy to quickly get small things out of the build area.                      
                  
Seraphim "Static 2 Transport" idea.
  * "A Static transport?"
    * Stargate-like thing.        

Seraphim Experimental Mine.
  * Bonus experimental for the field engy.
    * Releases a residual energy signature.
  * Possible self replicating mines.   
    
Aeon Experimental Assault Tank
  * Mostly finished texture that needs more details.
  * Has its big cannon and two TMD's.
  * Totally isn't an eldar grav tank. Nope nope nope. 

Aeon Experimental Shield projection tower.
  * Something between a shield gen and the eye of something or other in appearance.
  * Creates individual shields around each unit within the radius, probably with a ghost unit attached.
    * Shields should share an overall health, and need some way to scale with the unit it surrounds.
  * Multiple towers could cause some problems, but shields will likely take damage at the same time on a unit, due to being the same size. 

Cybran Experimental Missile ship
  * Initial ideas:
    * a cross between the Sea Shadow and a Houbei class missile boat.
    * Stealth, and tac missiles.
    * Possible strat missiles.
    * Possible cloak, disabled during firing and or really high power cost.
  * Current implementation:
    * A Battleship with legs.
    * Currently no functioning weapons, but can stamp on things. 
  * New idea:
    * Carrier/battleship. With legs.
    * Unique T3 fighter/bombers.               

Cybran Iron Curtain: Experimental Shield Generator
  * Functions as a shield.
  * Want the shield to shrink on damage.  
    * Need to adapt the force shield script for this. 
  * Possibly give it a better mesh.

Cybran Scathis Mk 2: Experimental Rapid-fire Artillery
  * Uses most of the parts of the original.
    * Is still buildable with 'No Game Enders' build restriction, ect.

Abandonned Experimental Ideas:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Seraphim Iyadesu: Experimental Engineering Platform
  * Massively overpowered, in all ways.
    * Removed, after a few Iyadesu dominated games.
    * Although it was gamewarping, it was fun so the source files were left around.
      * Changed as of r205
        * This nerfed Field Engineer version was also removed for still being OP on 2014-08-08.           

UEF Doomsday Machine: Experimental Point Defence
  * Was supposed to be a callback to the old TA unit.
    * An uninteresting idea badly implemented. Removed.
    * Was only still in the source files for nostalgia.
      * Removed as of r146

Other ideas:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
UEF Engineering Facility 'The Pound'
  * A facility that houses a large number of Rover drones.
  * Possibly just an expensive T3 unit.
  * Probably a bad idea.
  * Potential to have its idea merged in some way with the Gantry.

Anti-naval gunship.
