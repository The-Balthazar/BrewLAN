Errors list/the other to-do list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* The Atlantis ignores its rolloff orders from the Gantry.
* SRS0401 lacks weapons.
* Wilson lacks treadmarks for its front tracks.
* Zenith has unused bones.
* The Absolution can't hover over units.
* Other experimentals walk through armored walls.
* AI's dont propperly utilise their Gantries. 
* Megalith built eggs bug out when at the pop cap.
* Mobile anti nukes start building an anti nuke immediately, despite already having full capacity, leading to 2/1 built if it finishes.
  * The rate of fire of the mobile anti nukes also means that its likely to fire both at the same target, making having two redundant unless its a seraphim experimental nuke.
* Shields need a floatation when on water (Possibly easier to create a dummy unit under it), and possibly to recieve radius and maintenence cost increases when built on water.
* The Cybran T3 Cloakable Fab pauses its production when the cloak is disabled.
* Change the explosion graphics of the T2 power storages to propperly represent the explosion size.
* Add unit orders to the blips of the Aeon Decoy plane, if possible. (IssueGuard)
* Nuke mines should have the option to auto explode, but be set to manual from the off.
* Armored walls (and probably other walls) need to be repaired slower.

   ?  ???
    PROFIT!

UEF Experimental Assault Bot/tank
  * Either in the shape of a large Titan or more humanoid shaped OR a large assault tank.
    * Possibly a two part splitting bot. Cain and Abel or something cool.

UEF Centurion: Experimental AA gunship
  * Texture unfinished. Could be more efficiently UV mapped.     

UEF Ivan: Experimental Drop-Pod Artillery
  * Fires projectiles that look like drop pods and spawn mech marines on impact.
    * Bouncing script doesnt work on shields.
    * Range should probably decrease for large ammos.
    * Fucks up on aiming due to bone sharing.
    * Unfinished replacement model is on an old un-connected HDD, from the computer upgrade.
  * Might be able to get build things propperly, add them to storage, and attach them to the projectiles on fire.                                           
        
UEF Gantry: Experimental Factory
  * Almost completely 100% Fully funtional.
    * Still to do:                 
      * Hook \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua and/or \lua\factions.lua to get the idle icon working.
      * Maybe add some kind of pedistal effect for building aircraft upon, especially on water.
        * Would need to wait for the current unit to be completed, especially if its a ship.
        * Would also need some visual justification for it while not there, or to maybe comprised of energy effects.                       
      * Add a OnDamaged twitch animation. So it looks like its in pain.
      * The Atlantis gets stuck in it. IssueDive is used to get it out, but it forgets/ignores its orders at some point.
      * Small non-air units take forever to leave. Maybe use scripts from the Fatboy to quickly move them.                      
                  
Seraphim totally not a stargate
  * Will require two to be functional.
  * Use the script order interface, like the spy facilities.
  * Either mess with ferry orders, or use a trick similar to mines to let things walk through.            

Seraphim Experimental Mine?
  * To be an experimental for the field engy.
  * Possibile functions:  
    * Releasing a residual energy signature.
    * Self replicating mines.
    * Damage over time effect.       

Seraphim Experimental Shield projection facility.
  * Something between a shield gen and the eye of something or other in appearance.
  * To create individual shields around each unit within the radius, probably with a ghost unit attached.
    * Shields should share an overall health, and need some way to scale with the unit it surrounds.
  * Multiple towers could cause some problems, but shields will likely take damage at the same time on a unit, due to being the same size. 

Seraphim Iyadesu
  Formerly Experimental Engineer (Prior to r205)
  Formerly Experimental Field Engineer (As of r205, removed as 2014-08-08)
  Experimental Ressurection Unit
    * Script attached to the reclaim command.
    * Had to totally overwrite the old CreateWreckageProp function for it to work.                 

Aeon Absolution: Experimental Siege Tank
  * Mostly finished texture that needs more details.
  * Has its big cannon and two TMD's.
  * Totally isn't an eldar grav tank. Nope nope nope. 

Cybran Experimental Missile ship
  * Initial ideas:
    * a cross between the Sea Shadow and a Houbei class missile boat.
    * Stealth, and tac missiles.
    * Possible strat missiles.
    * Possible cloak, disabled during firing and or really high power cost.
  * Current implementation:
    * A Battleship with legs.
    * Currently no functioning weapons, but can stamp on things. 
  * New idea:
    * Carrier/battleship. With legs.
    * Unique T3 fighter/bombers.               

Cybran Iron Curtain: Experimental Shield Generator
  * Functions as a shield.
  * Used to want the shield to shrink on damage. Not sure anymore.  
    * Would need to adapt the force shield script for this.       
  * Not 100% satisfied with the current mesh.

Cybran Scathis Mk 2: Experimental Rapid-fire Artillery
  * Uses most of the parts of the original. 

Cybran Darkness: Experimental Omni Disruption Facility
  * Uses the model of the QAI Mainframe from the campaign.
  * One of its arms doesn't move, for some unknown reason.
  * Was briefly called Oscuras before reverting back to Darkness.
    * I realised that any unit for which I try to avoid refering to it by name, has a bad name. Sorry Kris.

Abandonned Ideas:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
UEF Doomsday Machine: Experimental Point Defence
  * Was supposed to be a callback to the old TA unit.
    * An uninteresting idea badly implemented. Removed.
    * Was only still in the source files for nostalgia.
      * Removed as of r146         
                                
UEF Engineering Facility 'The Pound'
  * A facility that houses a large number of Rover drones.
  * Do you want lag? Because this is how you get lag.

    * Script might also be usefull for the decoy planes.

Naval mine layer units and/or other better ways to deploy mines.
