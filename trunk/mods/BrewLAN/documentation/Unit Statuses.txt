General to-do list/ideas list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* Mobile Radar Jammers
* More aquatic buildings
* Naval mine layer units?
* Seraphim experimental mine. (Possibly releasing a residual energy signature as its thing, or a semi-persistant d-o-t)
* BARREL ROLL
* Give cloaked/stealthed units omni detection in the form of a blinky beep effect on their model, so you know when stealth is broken.
  * Might be easier to implement the other way round; the omni checks on detecting them.

Errors list/the other to-do list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
* The Atlantis ignores its rolloff orders from the Gantry.
* SRS0401 lacks weapons.
* SRA0306 has an intel error. (line 32)
* Wilson lacks treadmarks for its front tracks.
* Zenith has unused bones.
* The Absolution can't hover over walls and such.
  * Experiments with making it technically an aircraft had weird dalek-like side effects.
* Need to mess with \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua to get the idle icons of the field engineers and gantry working propperly.
  * Same also for all the field engineers.
* Megalith built eggs bug out when at the pop cap.
* Mobile anti nukes start building an anti nuke immediately, despite already having full capacity, leading to 2/1 built if it finishes.
  * The rate of fire of the mobile anti nukes also means that its likely to fire both at the same target, making having two redundant unless its a seraphim experimental nuke.
* Planned new Naval shield implementation: All shields aquatic, and recieve radius and cost increases when built on water.
* One race should get a T3 torpedo launcher that can be built on land.
* The Cybran T3 Cloakable Fab pauses its production when the cloak is disabled.
* Change the explosion graphics of the T2 power storages to propperly represent the explosion size.
* Add unit orders to the blips of the Aeon Decoy plane, if possible. (IssueGuard)

  		  * Firing cost needs changing to start low and increase slowly as an 'overheat' cost, like the Cybran one, but not quite. 
    	* T3 Sonar
    	  * Eventually want to give a different mesh.

    PROFIT!

UEF Experimental Assault Bot/tank
  * Either in the shape of a large Titan or more humanoid shaped OR a large assault tank.
    * Possibly a two part splitting bot. Cain and Abel or something cool.

UEF Centurion: Experimental AA gunship
  * Texture unfinished. Could be more efficiently UV mapped.     

UEF Ivan: Experimental Drop-Pod Artillery
  * Fires projectiles that look like drop pods and spawn mech marines on impact.
    * Bouncing script doesnt work on shields.
    * Range should probably decrease for large ammos.
    * Fucks up on aiming due to bone sharing.
    * Unfinished replacement model is on an old un-connected HDD, from the computer upgrade.
  * Might be able to get build things propperly, add them to storage, and attach them to the projectiles on fire.                                           
        
UEF Gantry: Experimental Factory
  * Almost completely 100% Fully funtional.
    * Still to do:                 
      * Hook \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua and/or \lua\factions.lua to get the idle icon working.
      * Maybe add some kind of pedistal effect for building aircraft upon, especially on water.
        * Would need to wait for the current unit to be completed, especially if its a ship.
        * Would also need some visual justification for it while not there, or to maybe comprised of energy effects.                       
      * Add a OnDamaged twitch animation. So it looks like its in pain.
      * The Atlantis gets stuck in it. IssueDive is used to get it out, but it forgets/ignores its orders at some point.
      * Small non-air units take forever to leave. Maybe use scripts from the Fatboy to quickly move them.                      
                  
Seraphim "Static 2 Transport" idea.
  * "A Static transport?"
    * Stargate-like thing.        

Seraphim Experimental Mine.
  * To be an experimental for the field engy.
  * Possibile functions:  
    * Releasing a residual energy signature.
    * Self replicating mines.
    * Damage over time effect.       
    
Aeon Experimental Assault Tank
  * Mostly finished texture that needs more details.
  * Has its big cannon and two TMD's.
  * Totally isn't an eldar grav tank. Nope nope nope. 

Aeon Experimental Shield projection tower.
  * Something between a shield gen and the eye of something or other in appearance.
  * To create individual shields around each unit within the radius, probably with a ghost unit attached.
    * Shields should share an overall health, and need some way to scale with the unit it surrounds.
  * Multiple towers could cause some problems, but shields will likely take damage at the same time on a unit, due to being the same size. 

Cybran Experimental Missile ship
  * Initial ideas:
    * a cross between the Sea Shadow and a Houbei class missile boat.
    * Stealth, and tac missiles.
    * Possible strat missiles.
    * Possible cloak, disabled during firing and or really high power cost.
  * Current implementation:
    * A Battleship with legs.
    * Currently no functioning weapons, but can stamp on things. 
  * New idea:
    * Carrier/battleship. With legs.
    * Unique T3 fighter/bombers.               

Cybran Iron Curtain: Experimental Shield Generator
  * Functions as a shield.
  * Want the shield to shrink on damage, maybe.  
    * Would need to adapt the force shield script for this. 
  * Not 100% satisfied with the current mesh.

Cybran Scathis Mk 2: Experimental Rapid-fire Artillery
  * Uses most of the parts of the original.
    * Is still buildable with 'No Game Enders' build restriction, ect.

Abandonned Ideas:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Seraphim Iyadesu: Experimental Engineering Platform
  * Massively overpowered, in all ways.
    * Removed, after a few Iyadesu dominated games.
    * Although it was gamewarping, it was fun so the source files were left around.
      * Changed as of r205
