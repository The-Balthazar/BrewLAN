  * Fixed the distance mesh for the Iron Curtain, that has been misslinked since the B-S unit code change.

  * Changed the Cybran T2 wall to be larger, and use the cardinal directions code. Currently uses the stripped down T3 mesh.            
__________.__________
2014-08-31|0.4.B

* Added additional compatability scripts for the Gantry building units with other mods enabled.

  * Created a ghetto work around for the Atlantis getting stuck in the Gantry. Very ghetto fix.
  __________
  2014-08-27
  
  * Created a script class for the UEF engineering resource generators, so there is less copied code.   
    * Script now checks how far away the instigator is, and does nothing if its too far away, then checks the instigator layer instead of its categories when deciding what to build.
      * Too far away is considered over *3 its visual range.
      * If the units layer is water it alternates between trying to build a torpedo or point defence, incase it can't reach the water for a torpedo.
  * The Engineering Power Generator now aims with all its arms, instead of just the first.
  * Fixed a long standing bug with the Gantry being able to have its costs reduced, through adjacency, to 0 of any one resource.

    * Partial setup of a script for the Cybran Hades to have its energy drain per second increase by 10 for every half second its active and decrease by 30 for every half second its inactive. (It doesn't subtract correcrly, and currently breaks the economy.)
  __________
  2014-08-20

      Fatboy into the Gantry, had a fake AA weapon with no targetting restrictions
      (because it could never fire it) and BlackOps had a script that tried to
      give all AA weapons a restriction so they couldn't shoot their nuke
      satelite, which failed when it found a weapon with no restrictions.

  * Fixed the Solaris only being able to fire its AA in one direction.
    * This wasn't actually that noticable because it used to turn without
      changing where it was flying, but it meant it could only really shoot
      things one one side of it.
