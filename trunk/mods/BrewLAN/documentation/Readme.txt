	|Intro

BrewLAN is a unitpack and balancing mod for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance with a number of changes and additions at all tech levels for all factions, including Seraphim. The design goals for the mod are simple; to add new and interesting and visually aesthetic units which complement those already in existence and to maximise technical compatibility with other mods, even if said mods may be incompatible in concept.

The name BrewLAN is taken from Joshua Wilsons infamous LAN party of the same name, where the mod in its earliest incarnation saw its first multiplayer usage, and where lots of cups of tea were consumed.
